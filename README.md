## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Comparison of Agile and Waterfall Methodologies
Agile and Waterfall are two distinct software development approaches. Waterfall follows a linear, sequential process, where each phase (requirements, design, development, testing, and deployment) must be completed before moving to the next. In contrast, Agile is iterative and flexible, allowing continuous development, testing, and improvements throughout the project lifecycle.

One of the key differences between the two is flexibility. Waterfall is rigid and works best when all requirements are well-defined at the start, making it suitable for projects with fixed scopes like government systems or banking software. Agile, however, is highly adaptable, making it ideal for dynamic projects such as mobile apps or SaaS products, where customer feedback and evolving needs are common.

In terms of testing and collaboration, Waterfall typically conducts testing at the end of the development cycle, which can lead to costly rework if issues are discovered late. Agile integrates continuous testing throughout the process, helping to identify and fix issues early. Waterfall relies heavily on detailed documentation, with minimal client involvement after the initial planning, while Agile promotes ongoing collaboration between developers and stakeholders, ensuring that the final product aligns with user needs.

Each methodology has its advantages and disadvantages. Waterfall provides a clear structure, well-documented processes, and predictable timelines, but it struggles with adaptability and late-stage changes. Agile allows for faster delivery, adaptability, and frequent client feedback, but it requires high collaboration and can be challenging to manage in large teams.

Ultimately, the choice between Agile and Waterfall depends on project requirements, scope, and flexibility needs. Waterfall is best for well-structured projects with stable requirements, while Agile is ideal for fast-paced, evolving projects that require frequent adjustments.
